This assay will identify alleles of all sizes but cannot determine methylation status of expanded alleles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;\"><\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;\">LIMITATIONS<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;\">In &gt;99% of cases, fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of CGG repeat sequences in the FMR1 gene; non-expansion type mutations are not detected by this assay. This interpretation is based on the clinical information provided and the current understanding of the molecular genetics of this condition. Although DNA-based testing provides highly accurate results, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Examples include misinterpretation because of polymorphisms or rare genetic variants, blood transfusion, mislabeled specimens. Bone marrow transplants from allogenic donors will interfere with testing. This test detects full mutation expansions up to at least 1200 CGG repeats, and accurately sizes products with &le; 200 CGG repeats.&nbsp; The accuracy of this methodology is +/- 1 for 0-54 CGG repeats, +/- 2 for 55-70 CGG repeats, +/- 3 for 71-120 CGG repeats, and +/- 5 for 121-200 CGG repeats. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;\"><\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;\">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;\">For references, please visit: progenity.com/references.
